## Usage

### Configure MCP in Cursor IDE

To use this server with Cursor IDE, add the following MCP configuration:

1. Open Cursor
2. Create `.cursor/mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "1panel-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "1panel-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ONEPANEL_BASE_URL": "<your 1Panel base URL>",
        "ONEPANEL_API_KEY": "<your 1Panel API key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Use MCP to Deploy Websites

In Cursor, you can deploy websites using the following command in the AI chat:

```plaintext
Deploy to 1Panel with domain=yourdomain.com
```

Or you can use the following format:

```plaintext
Deploy website to 1Panel server, domain: yourdomain.com
```

## API Reference

### MCP Tool: deploy_website

Deploys a website to 1Panel.

**Parameters:**

- `domain` (required): Website domain
- `buildDir` (optional): Build directory path

**Response:**

```plaintext
Successfully deployed to 1Panel!
Domain: yourdomain.com
URL: http://yourdomain.com
Upload statistics:
- Total files: 25
- Successfully uploaded: 25
- Failed to upload: 0
```

## Implementation Details

### Deployment Process

1. **Check Build Directory**: Verifies if the specified build directory exists
2. **Website Creation**: Creates a new static website through 1Panel API if it doesn't exist
3. **File Upload**: Uploads all files from the build directory to the website
4. **Statistics**: Returns detailed statistics about the upload process

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter deployment issues, check the following:

1. Ensure your API Key is valid and has sufficient permissions
2. Verify that the website directory exists and has write permissions
3. Check the 1Panel server logs for more detailed error information
4. If file uploads fail, it may be due to file permission or format issues
